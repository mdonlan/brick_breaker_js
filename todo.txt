Brick Breaker JS TODO

1. make hit on the paddle bounce based off where they hit on the paddle
    -ex. if the ball hits the far left of the paddle the ball should bound very left, rather than just reverseing it's yVel, which is what were doing now
2. increase ball speed over time
3. camera shake
4. sounds
5. start mode 
    -- start in a paused state and allow the player to click start, then have a countdown
6. instant replay closeup or ball missing paddle?
7. add power up blocks
    -- these blocks when hit will drop a power up
    -- the player must move the paddle to 'catch' the power up or it will not activate
8. fix weird paddle / ball behaviour when then ball hits the side of the paddle
    -- the ball goes horizontally though the paddle until it comes out the other side
    
9. check for ball / box collision on all four sides of box
    -- right now when we hit a box we just invert y, but if we hit the left or right side of the box we actually want to invert the x rather than the y
